      <description>Update 1 - I&amp;rsquo;m clarifying the definition of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and Financially Motivated Actors (FMAs). I combined the two groups in the previous version. The content and focus of the discussion primarily centers on FMAs. APTs and FMAs can overlap in terms of TTPs, capabilities, personnel, countries, etc. What distinguishes them is motivation. FMAs, as their name implies, are financially motivated. APTs can have a number of motivations including financial, political, etc.</description>

      <description>On a recent Purple Team engagement, I was accessing the client&amp;rsquo;s Splunk cloud instance. Being my normal typo-filled self, I fat fingered the URL and went to clieent.splunkcloud.com instead of the correct client.splunkcloud.com. Instead of being redirected to the login portal, I received a DNS resolution error, fixed the typo, and moved on. A little while later, I was thinking about the typo again and wondered how this information leakage could be utilized by an attacker.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of people reach out about how to get started with our automation. This is part one of a multipart series where we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to get started with our automation. In this post, I show how to get the automation installed, a payload up and running, and executing a basic module. You can check out the blog here or watch the YouTube video.</description>

      <description>I wrote a blog post on Praetorian&amp;rsquo;s website explaining why we chose to benchmark detection and response to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK™. You can check out the blog here.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the Future of Command and Control with Wikipedia</title>

      <description>This tool demonstrates what I believe will be the future of Command and Control (C2) for Red Teams and potentially Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). With Domain Fronting slowly being killed by major CDNs and security teams getting better at looking for unusual sites (I still love that detection for new sites encrypted with LetsEncrypt certificates), Red Teams will look for alternate ways to hide their traffic. What better way than to utilize features of common sites that users are visiting anyways?</description>
