      <description>Twitter is a complicated social networking platform. Then again, which platform isn&amp;rsquo;t? I&amp;rsquo;m fairly new to the platform, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already found that it can be a tremendous resource when it comes to receiving up-to-date information on new techniques, upcoming talks, or nifty vulnerabilities. What I haven&amp;rsquo;t found it useful for is having discussions, especially those surrounding a controversial idea. This has manifested in my feed over the past month with the discussion around the release of Offensive Security Tools, primarily ignited by Andrew Thompson (@QW5kcmV3).</description>

      <description>On a recent Purple Team engagement, I was accessing the client&amp;rsquo;s Splunk cloud instance. Being my normal typo-filled self, I fat fingered the URL and went to clieent.splunkcloud.com instead of the correct client.splunkcloud.com. Instead of being redirected to the login portal, I received a DNS resolution error, fixed the typo, and moved on. A little while later, I was thinking about the typo again and wondered how this information leakage could be utilized by an attacker.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of people reach out about how to get started with our automation. This is part one of a multipart series where we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to get started with our automation. In this post, I show how to get the automation installed, a payload up and running, and executing a basic module. You can check out the blog here or watch the YouTube video.</description>

      <description>I wrote a blog post on Praetorian&amp;rsquo;s website explaining why we chose to benchmark detection and response to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK™. You can check out the blog here.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the Future of Command and Control with Wikipedia</title>

      <description>This tool demonstrates what I believe will be the future of Command and Control (C2) for Red Teams and potentially Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). With Domain Fronting slowly being killed by major CDNs and security teams getting better at looking for unusual sites (I still love that detection for new sites encrypted with LetsEncrypt certificates), Red Teams will look for alternate ways to hide their traffic. What better way than to utilize features of common sites that users are visiting anyways?</description>
