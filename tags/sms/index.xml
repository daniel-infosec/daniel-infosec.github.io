      <description>Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher I really respect, recently published a blog post stating his opinions on SMS 2FA. I highly encourage you to read his post first so that you&amp;rsquo;ll have the necessary context. For brevity, I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you&amp;rsquo;re aware what 2FA is and how SMS 2FA works. In general, I believe I can summarize Tavis&amp;rsquo; argument as follows:
 SMS 2FA can by bypassed by advanced phishing attacks Even if SMS 2FA raises the bar, the effort spent implementing SMS 2FA can be spent on other things  I think an important question that Tavis either explicitly or accidentally omitted is &amp;ldquo;for whom&amp;rdquo;.</description>
