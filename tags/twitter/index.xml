      <description>I think an important question that Tavis either explicitly or accidentally omitted is &amp;ldquo;for whom&amp;rdquo;. I am not sure why he did not include this as it&amp;rsquo;s a critical component to his argument. If Tavis is stating that &amp;ldquo;SMS 2FA is ineffective for an enterprise&amp;rdquo;, then I would agree. The threat model that he is operating from is that an organization is being explicitly targeted by a motivated (though not necessarily extremely capable) attacker, who only needs minimal access to cause great harm.</description>

      <description>On a recent Purple Team engagement, I was accessing the clientâ€™s Splunk cloud instance. Being my normal typo-filled self, I fat fingered the URL and went to clieent.splunkcloud.com instead of the correct client.splunkcloud.com. Instead of being redirected to the login portal, I received a DNS resolution error, fixed the typo, and moved on. A little while later, I was thinking about the typo again and wondered how this information leakage could be utilized by an attacker.</description>
