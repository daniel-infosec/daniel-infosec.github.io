      <description>This is not financial advice. These are just my musings and thoughts on the current situation in the markets.
Ever since mid-February, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the market retract with Qs closing below 300 and SPY also seeing some drops. When we look deeper into the individual stocks that compromise these indexes, I think we&amp;rsquo;ll find a different story. Before we do, we need to take a detour into bonds.
The relationship between bonds, yields, and interest rates is fairly basic, but having almost no background in finance, it took me a bit to try to understand it.</description>
