      <title>Demonstrating the Future of Command and Control with Wikipedia</title>

      <description>This work was inspired by my coworker&amp;rsquo;s (Josh Abraham) work to demonstrate alternative forms of Command and Control. Some of his POCs included demonstrations using Slack and ICMP for C2. While these techniques aren&amp;rsquo;t revolutionary, the simplicity of the POC and how hard it was to detect confirmed my suspicion that the future of C2 is going to be tunneling traffic via features of well-known applications.
In addition, there was a recent Twitter post from @randomuserid that got me thinking about what other sites besides Slack could be utilized.</description>
