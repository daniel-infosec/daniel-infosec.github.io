      <description>Intro Raise your hand if you&amp;rsquo;ve worked on suppressing a false positive for a detector and then the very next day, it&amp;rsquo;s back in your &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; queue with another false positive. I&amp;rsquo;d expect almost everyone who&amp;rsquo;s worked in detection engineering for any period of time has their hand raised or is nodding along. Why does this happen? Well, sometimes the detector itself isn&amp;rsquo;t very good and it&amp;rsquo;s alerting on a lot of benign behavior.</description>

      <description>Intro &amp;ldquo;If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&amp;rdquo;
This mantra about possibly non-existent trees very much applies to detection engineers. If you write a great rule to detect malicious behavior, but no one (or nothing) acts upon the alert, did you really catch the threat actor? Or worse, an analyst acts on the alert but responds incorrectly. In this article, I will cover the importance of not only writing solid detections, but also solid alerts.</description>

      <title>Real Time vs Scheduled Query Detections - A Guide For Detection Engineers</title>

      <description>Most modern SIEMs offer 2 primary methods for running their queries: real time rules and scheduled queries. Each option offers a variety of pros and cons that you should consider as you develop your detection. Before we dive into that, let&amp;rsquo;s clarify what we mean by each.
Definitions A real time rule, often called a streaming rule, runs on a stream of data. Essentially, as the data enters the SIEM, each data point will get processed against the rules that correspond with that kind of data.</description>
